Calculate the total bill before tax.
Add 10% tax to get the final bill.
Check if the final bill is within the budget or exceeds it.
Input Format

The first line contains two integers: cost1 quantity1

The second line contains two integers: cost2 quantity2

The third line contains two integers: cost3 quantity3

The fourth line contains one integer: budget

Constraints

1 <= cost, quantity, budget <= 10^5
Use float or double for tax calculation
Tax is fixed at 10%
Output Format

Print the total before tax and after tax (formatted to 2 decimal places), and then print:
"Within Budget" if the final bill is less than or equal to the budget
"Over Budget" otherwise
