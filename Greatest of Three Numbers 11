You are given three integers. Your task is to find and print the greatest number among them.
If two or more numbers are equal and greatest, print that number with a note:
There is a tie for the greatest number
Input Format

The first line contains an integer a
The second line contains an integer b
The third line contains an integer c
Constraints

-1000 <= a, b, c <= 1000
Output Format

If one number is strictly the greatest, print:
X is the greatest
If thereâ€™s a tie for the greatest, print:
There is a tie for the greatest number
Sample Input 0

10  
20  
30
Sample Output 0

30 is the greatest
Sample Input 1

100  
100  
50
Sample Output 1

There is a tie for the greatest number

            else if(b==a || b==c){
                System.out.println("There is a tie for the greatest number");
